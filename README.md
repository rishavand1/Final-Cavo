## Customization Guide

### Modifying Content

#### Service Cards

To modify the services displayed on the website, edit the `serviceData` array in `client/src/lib/constants.ts`:

```typescript
// Services data
export const serviceData = [
  {
    iconName: "code-bracket", // This uses heroicons - see available icons at heroicons.com
    title: "AI Automation",
    description: "Smart automation solutions that streamline workflows..."
  },
  // Add or edit more services here
];
```

#### Service Details (Learn More)

When a user clicks "Learn More" on a service card, they'll see a dialog with detailed information about that service. You can modify these details in the `ServiceDetails.tsx` component:

```typescript
// In client/src/components/ServiceDetails.tsx
const servicesDetails = {
  "AI Automation": {
    title: "ðŸ¤– AI-Powered / Machine Learning Services",
    services: [
      {
        name: "Chatbots & Virtual Assistants (LLMs)",
        description: "Smart bots that talk like humans and solve customer queries 24/7."
      },
      // Add or edit more details here
    ]
  },
  // Other services...
};
```

Make sure that the key (e.g., "AI Automation") matches exactly with the `title` field in the corresponding service card from `serviceData`.

#### Project Cards

To modify the projects displayed, edit the `projectData` array in the same file:

```typescript
// Project data
export const projectData = [
  {
    image: "https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1551434678-e076c223a692?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&auto=format&fit=crop&w=800&q=80",
    title: "AI-Powered Analytics Dashboard",
    description: "A comprehensive analytics solution with AI-driven insights...",
    tags: ["AI", "Data Visualization", "React"],
    link: "#"
  },
  // Add or edit more projects here
];
```

#### Team Members

To modify team members information, edit the `teamData` array:

```typescript
// Team data
export const teamData = [
  {
    image: "https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1568602471122-7832951cc4c5?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&auto=format&fit=crop&w=200&q=80",
    name: "Rishav Anand",
    role: "CEO & Founder"
  },
  // Add or edit more team members here
];
```

### Modifying Pages

#### Home Page

To modify the home page content, edit `client/src/pages/Home.tsx`. 

#### Services Page

To modify the services page, edit `client/src/pages/Services.tsx`. 

#### About Page

To modify the about page, edit `client/src/pages/About.tsx`.

#### Contact Page

To modify the contact page, edit `client/src/pages/Contact.tsx`.

### Styling

#### Theme Colors

To change the theme colors, you can modify the gradient colors and background colors in the components. The main colors used throughout the site are:

- Primary blue: `#4F8FFF`
- Secondary purple: `#9D4EDD`
- Background dark: `#0A0A10`
- Dark sections: `#050507`
- Card backgrounds: `#2A2A3A`

You can change these colors by searching for them in the codebase and replacing them with your preferred colors.

#### Tailwind Configuration

For more extensive styling changes, you can modify the Tailwind configuration in `tailwind.config.ts`.

### Adding Pages

To add a new page to the website:

1. Create a new page component in `client/src/pages/`
2. Add the route in `client/src/App.tsx`:

```typescript
// In App.tsx
<Route path="/your-new-page" component={YourNewPage} />
```

3. Add a link to the page in the navigation by updating the `navItems` array in `client/src/components/Navbar.tsx`:

```typescript
const navItems = [
  // ... existing items
  { id: "your-new-page", label: "Your New Page", path: "/your-new-page" }
];
```
